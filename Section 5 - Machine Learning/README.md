## Section 5: Machine Learning

This section will cover building a Machine Learning model to predict the price of Buying Price of a car.

In this section Jupyter Notebook running on Python 3.9 will be used
Documentation of this section will be cover in the Notebook
 
### Summary of task:

1. Train models to predict Buying Price (Classification Problem)
	- Ensemble model
		- Random forest model
		- Logistic regression model
		- Decision tree model
		- Naive Bayes model
2. Evaluate the model performance
3. Save trained model for future use
4. Using another notebook load trained model to perform prediction
